# The Rocket Launch App Home Challenge  <!-- omit in toc -->

This is my implementation of [Home challenge](Mobile%20Task%20-%20The%20Rocket%20Launch%20App%20Home%20Challenge.pdf). In [TODO](#todo) I wrote my tasks, which I resolved/planned to. Also here presented git private repo, which contain my development history. 

For fast start, install [nodejs](https://nodejs.or) and type in your CLI:
```
npm i && npm start
```

## Technical design

### Domain

### Scroll workflow
![Scroll flowchart](docs/Scroll.png)

### Load next launches workflow

The main idea to not exceed some render limit, when we scroll for a long time.
Below I try to show some abstract infinity scrollable tape, which has limited render zone.
```
                           |     |  - empty
                        |---------- - load trigger zone
                        | || ... ||
                        | ||     || - render zone
            constant    | ||=====||
launches <= max size ---| ||/////|| - view zone
                        | ||=====||
                        | ||     || - render zone
                        | || ... ||
                        |---------- - load trigger zone
                           |     |  - empty
```
Here is flowchart of possible implementation:

## Afterwords
Thanks for reading until here :). 
h
For me, the main goal in this challenge, was to demonstrate how I develops some kind of application. Most technologies/libs/frameworks presented here I used previously. Exceptions are React hooks and emojis ðŸ˜†.

There are also more things to do:
* some bugs of course ("jerky" scrolling; scroll in top direction?; specific ui of course :)) 
* todos (for such project global store are more prefable; more tests, including ui)
* perfomance improvements (more accurate estimation of render zone; aggressive caching with save in local storage more items)
And I think, that I can solve, but with more time. But I believe that the main goal at this stage I have achieved.

In conclusion, there was a nice challenge for me, and thank you for reviewing!

## Generated docs

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
